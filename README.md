## Installing Server & Client
Maybe you have to install yarn globally (and any other that throws errors).

Installing a package globally:
`npm i package_name -g`
'npm install [package-name]@[version-number]'

packages:
* yarn
* rollup
* 

If you dont have npm installed, follow:
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

If you get any weird troubles, try to match with my node version: v14.15.5 and npm version: 6.14.11

1. `cd client && yarn`
2. `cd server && yarn`


## Run the projects:
1. Open two terminals
2. In one, `cd client && yarn dev`
3. In the another, `cd serer && yarn dev`
